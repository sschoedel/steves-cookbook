# Braised Beef Short Ribs

Source: Food Republic
Author: John Besh

## Ingredients

- 4 lbs beef short ribs, cut flanken style (across the bone) or English style (parallel to the bone)
- Coarse salt and black pepper
- 3 cups zinfandel
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 6 oz canned chopped tomatoes
- 2 cups beef broth
- 1 tbsp minced garlic
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme, picked off stem
- 2 bay leaves
- 3 oz canola oil
- 1 large onion, diced (2 cups)
- 2 medium carrots, diced (1/2 cup)
- 2 stalks celery, diced (1/2 cup)
- 2 oz dried mushrooms, preferably porcini

## Instructions

1. Season the short ribs with salt and pepper; be rather generous.

2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the Zinfandel, sugar, tomatoes, beef broth, garlic, thyme, bay leaves, and a pinch of salt.

3. Pour the canola oil into a heavy pot or Dutch oven (at least 5 quarts) and place over high heat. When the oil is hot, working in small batches, brown the meat. Turn each piece to brown on all sides before removing from the pot.

4. When all the beef is browned and removed from the pot, add the onion, carrots, and celery, allowing the onion to cook until browned, about 10 minutes, stirring frequently.

5. Return the beef to the pot along with the wine mixture. Allow the wine mixture to come to a boil before reducing heat, skimming fat from the surface.

6. After simmering for several minutes, add the mushrooms. Cover and simmer over very low heat until meat is fork tender and nearly falling off the bone, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

7. Once the beef has cooked, remove from the pot and keep warm. Turn up the heat and reduce the pot liquid until thickened, about 10 minutes.

8. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the ribs to four shallow bowls, spooning the liquid over the top.

## Notes

- Ribs cut flanken style (across the bone) are easier to deal with than those cut English style (parallel to the bone), but are slightly more fatty.
- A sturdy pot that conducts heat well has a lot to do with the success of this dish. Get yourself a cast-iron pot.
