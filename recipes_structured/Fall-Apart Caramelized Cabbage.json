  "servings": "4",
  "ingredients": [
    "1/4 cup double-concentrated tomato paste",
    "3 garlic cloves, finely grated",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin",
    "1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes",
    "1 medium head of green or savoy cabbage (about 2 lb)",
    "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided",
    "Kosher salt",
    "3 tablespoons chopped dill, parsley, or cilantro",
    "Full-fat Greek yogurt or sour cream (for serving)",
    "Coarsely cracked black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat oven to 350°F. Mix tomato paste, garlic, coriander, cumin, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl.",
    "Cut cabbage in half through core. Cut each half into 4 wedges.",
    "Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Working in batches if needed, arrange cabbage in pan, cut side down, and season with salt. Cook until cut sides are lightly charred, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer cabbage to a plate.",
    "Pour remaining 1/4 cup oil into same skillet. Add spiced tomato paste, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring often, until beginning to split and darkened slightly, about 3 minutes.",
    "Pour in water to come halfway up sides of pan (about 1 1/2 cups), season with salt, and bring to a simmer. Nestle cabbage wedges back into skillet (they should have shrunk while browning; a bit of overlap is okay).",
    "Transfer skillet to oven and bake cabbage, turning halfway through, until liquid is mostly evaporated and cabbage is deeply browned around the edges and very tender, 40-50 minutes.",
    "To serve, scatter herbs over cabbage; top with yogurt and pepper."
