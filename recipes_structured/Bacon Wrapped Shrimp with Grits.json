  "instructions": [
    "For the shrimp: Season shrimp with a little kosher salt. Using a hot grill, quickly mark each shrimp. Remove from grill and allow to cool. Shrimp should still be uncooked.",
    "When cool enough to handle, wrap each shrimp with a half piece of bacon. Season with cracked black pepper.",
    "Sear the shrimp in grapeseed oil until crispy on both sides. Set aside until rest of dish is ready.",
    "For the grits: Using a deep saucepan, combine chicken stock and milk. Bring to a simmer, add butter, and allow time for it to dissolve.",
    "Slowly whisk in grits a little at a time. When grits begin to thicken, lower heat.",
    "Switch to a spatula and fold in the corn, cilantro, poblano peppers, black pepper, and cheddar cheese. Adjust seasonings if needed. If grits are too thick, add more chicken stock.",
    "For the chipotle-tomato butter sauce: In a sauce pot, saute onions and garlic over medium heat.",
    "Add tomatoes, chipotle peppers and peppercorns. Continue to cook for another 3 minutes.",
    "Deglaze with chicken stock and lower heat. Cook 5 minutes, then place in a blender and blend until smooth.",
