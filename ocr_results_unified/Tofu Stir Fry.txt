2. Once the tofu has drained, slice in half then into 1/2 inch cubes and place into a large bowl and season with 1 tablespoon soy sauce.
3. Sprinkle cornstarch on top and gently toss with your hands to ensure all tofu pieces are covered.
4. In a large nonstick skillet or wok, add 1 tablespoon oil and heat to medium-high.
5. Add the tofu and let it get crispy without touching it or flipping for 3-4 minutes, then repeat on all sides.
6. Remove tofu and set aside.
7. To the skillet at medium heat, add sesame oil, red peppers, broccolini and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
8. Add the garlic and ginger and cook 30 to 60 seconds.
9. Add the tofu and sauce, toss and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes, or until sauce is slightly thickened and the tofu is heated through.
10. Top with sesame seeds.
