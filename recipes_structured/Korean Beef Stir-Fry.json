  "ingredients": [
    "3 tablespoons mirin",
    "2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce",
    "2 teaspoons cornstarch",
    "1 tablespoon canola oil",
    "8 ounces flank steak, trimmed of fat and very thinly sliced against the grain",
    "1 tablespoon chopped garlic",
    "2 teaspoons chopped jalapeno pepper, or to taste",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger",
    "4 cups mung bean sprouts",
    "1 (6-ounce) bag baby spinach",
    "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro",
    "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil",
    "2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds (optional)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Combine mirin, soy sauce and cornstarch in a small bowl.",
    "Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Spread steak out in the pan and cook until seared on one side, about 1 minute. Add garlic, jalapeno and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add bean sprouts and spinach (the pan will be very full). Pour the mirin mixture into the pan and stir gently until the sauce thickens and the spinach is wilted, about 3 minutes. Stir in cilantro and sesame oil. Serve topped with sesame seeds (if using)."

  "notes": [
    "If you have a little extra time before dinner, put the steak in the freezer for about 20 minutes to help make it easier to slice thinly.",
    "To toast sesame seeds, heat a small dry skillet over low heat. Add sesame seeds and stir constantly until golden and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool.",
    "Mirin is a low-alcohol rice wine essential to Japanese cooking. Look for it in the Asian or gourmet-ingredients section of your supermarket. An equal portion of sherry or white wine with a pinch of sugar may be substituted for mirin.",
    "People with celiac disease or gluten-sensitivity should use soy sauces that are labeled 'gluten-free,' as soy sauce may contain wheat or other gluten-containing sweeteners and flavors."
