- 3 medium japanese eggplant, cut into 1/2-inch-thick half-moons (3 cups)
- 1 pound sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 3 cups)
- 3 tablespoons canola oil
- 1 large white onion, thinly sliced (about 3 cups)
- 10 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced (about 2 tablespoons)
- 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
- 3/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste
- 2 (13.6-ounce) cans unsweetened coconut milk
- 1 (5-ounce) package baby spinach
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus cilantro leaves for garnish
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint, plus mint leaves for garnish
- 1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions
- 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from 2 limes)
- 1 teaspoon sambal oelek or chile paste
- Cooked jasmine rice and lime wedges, for serving

# Directions

## Step 1

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. In separate batches, cook the vegetables (in this order: haricots verts, zucchini, eggplant, and sweet potato) until each vegetable is almost al dente, 1 minute and 30 seconds for haricots verts, 2 to 3 minutes for

zucchini and eggplant, and 6 to 8 minutes for sweet potatoes. Drain vegetables, and transfer to a baking sheet; set aside.

## Step 2

Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium. Add onion, garlic, ginger, salt, and black pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, 5 to 6 minutes.

## Step 3

Stir in coconut milk, scraping bottom of Dutch oven to remove any browned bits. Bring to a boil over medium-high. Fold in spinach until it begins to wilt, about 1 minute. Stir in reserved vegetables. Bring to a simmer over medium; cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors meld, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in cilantro, mint, scallions, lime juice, and sambal oelel. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Garnish with cilantro and mint leaves; serve with rice and lime wedges.
