## Ingredients

- 4 ears corn on the cob
- 2 avocados diced
- 2 cups arugula
- 2 cups cherry tomatoes halved
- ½ cup feta cheese crumbles
- 1 tablespoon fresh mint leaves roughly chopped
- lime mint dressing to taste
- 2 to 4 halibut fillets 6 to 8 ounces each

## lime mine dressing

- ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 tablespoon honey
- pinch of salt less than ⅛ teaspoon
- pinch of white pepper less than ⅛ teaspoon
- 1 tablespoon mint leaves

## Instructions

1. Prep the corn. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Shuck the corn of the husk and silk. Carefully add to the pot of hot water and cook for 5 minutes. Drain and let cool. Once cool, cut the corn off the cob and set aside.
2. Make the dressing. In a bowl, whisk together the ¼ cup olive oil, 2 tablespoons lime juice, 1 tablespoon honey, pinch of salt and white pepper, and 1 tablespoon fresh mint. For an emulsified dressing, combine all the ingredients except the olive oil using an immersion

blender or food processor. Then add the olive oil in a slow steady stream while the blender is running.

3. Make the salad. In a large bowl or platter, spread the arugula over the bottom. Top with halved cherry tomatoes, diced avocado, feta, corn, and fresh mint. Drizzle the dressing over the salad the ingredients.

4. Sear the halibut. Pat the fillets with a paper towel to absorb any excess moisture. Season generously with salt and fresh black pepper. Heat ¼ cup canola oil in a sauté pan over high heat. When the oil is hot, carefully place the fillets skin side up and lower the heat to medium-high. Cook for 5 minutes, lower the heat again to medium and flip the halibut to skin side down. Cook for another 4 to 5 minutes or until the center of the fish reaches 140°F. Serve the fish on top of the salad or alongside.

## Notes

- This salad is a great way to use up leftover corn on the cob!
- Alternatively to boiling the corn, you can grill it or cut it off the cob and toast it in a cast iron pan with a little drizzle of oil.
- Want a little more savory? Try adding crispy bacon or prosciutto!
- Because of the avocado, this salad does not make for great leftovers so we recommend eating it the day you make it!
