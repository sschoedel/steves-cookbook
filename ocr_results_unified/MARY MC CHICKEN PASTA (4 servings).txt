MARY MC CHICKEN PASTA (4 servings)

1.5 lbs skinless boneless chicken thighs
9 oz package fresh fettucine
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp dried Rosemary
1 tsp Red Pepper Flakes
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp. Black Pepper
3 garlic cloves thinly sliced
1/2 cup sun dried tomatoes - finely chopped
1.5 cups Chicken Broth or Stock
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup shredded or shaved parmesan
Fresh Basil

- Season chicken with Salt & Pepper
- Add olive oil to a large skillet or pan (big enough to hold everything)

- Med. Hist. Heat - Sear the chicken about 5-6 minutes each side
- Once Seared, set aside on a plate
- I like to cut the chicken into strips - it's ok if it is not 100% cooked at this point. It will finish cooking in the sauce
- Add garlic & chopped sun-dried tomatoes low heat for 1-2 minutes
- Add the chicken stock to deglaze the pan. Scrape up any bits (low heat)
- Boil water for pasta
- Add cream to sauce
- Add back chicken and all spices - combine
- Simmer while pasta starts to cook
- Add Parmesan cheese (chaff) to the sauce
- Sauce should start to thicken 5 to 10 minutes
- Add pasta to water - this should take about 2 minutes to cook
- Add pasta to chicken/sauce, combine thoroughly.
- Add a few spoonfuls of pasta water (maybe a ladle)
- Add fresh basil and rest of Parmesan Cheese
- Serve and propose
