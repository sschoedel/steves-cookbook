DIFFICULTY: EASY

Traditional one-pot chicken cacciatore is a quick, flavoursome dinner idea best served with pasta.

## INGREDIENTS

1 tbs olive oil
4 chicken thigh cutlets, skin on and bone in
1 onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed
2 tsp chopped rosemary leaves
1 red capsicum, cut into strips
1 cup (120g) pitted green olives, halved
1 cup (250ml) red wine
400g can chopped tomatoes
1 tbs chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves
1 cup (170g) instant polenta, cooked to packet instructions (optional)

## METHOD

1. Heat oil in a large, deep frypan over medium heat. Pat the chicken dry with paper towel, then season and place, skin-side down, in the pan. Cook for 4 minutes or until skin is golden, then turn and cook for a further 1 minute or until browned. Transfer to a plate.

2. Return the pan to medium heat with the onion and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until softened. Add the garlic and rosemary, then cook for a further 1 minute or until fragrant. Add the capsicum, olives and red wine, then cook for 3-4 minutes until the liquid is reduced by half. Add tomato, then return the chicken, skin-side up, to the pan. Bring to a simmer and cook for 12 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.

3. Garnish with parsley and serve with polenta, if desired.
