# Fresh Cranberry Compote

Serve any leftover compote on buttered bread, with pound cake, over ice cream, or on leftover turkey sandwiches.

PREP 15 min. STAND 6 hrs.

2 12-oz. bags of fresh cranberries
2 oranges, seeded and coarsely chopped
1 large Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, and coarsely chopped
¼ cup Grand Marnier or orange juice
1 cup white sugar
2 whole cinnamon sticks
½ tsp. fresh shaved nutmeg

Place cranberries, oranges, and apple in a food processor (in batches if needed). Pulse 8 to 10 times or until mixture is coarsely chopped. Once pulsed, transfer to a large bowl and add the Grand Marnier, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix well to incorporate, cover with plastic, and let stand at room temperature for at least 6 hours or, ideally, overnight (refrigerate if using orange juice rather than Grand Marnier). This will allow the fruit to macerate and break down into a sauce. After 6 hours, taste and adjust sweetness with additional sugar as desired. Refrigerate and store up to 2 weeks. Remove cinnamon sticks before serving. Makes 8 to 10 servings.

# Roasted Holiday Vegetables

PREP 25 min. ROAST 35 min. OVEN 400°F

1 Tbsp. fennel seed
2 lb. Yukon gold potatoes, unpeeled, cut in chunks or wedges
1 large yellow onion, cut in half and sliced thick
2 heads fennel, cored and cut in wedges the same thickness as the onion slices (optional: reserve tops for serving)
2 sprigs fresh rosemary
2 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Toast the fennel seed in a skillet over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes, shaking the pan often to prevent seeds from burning. (Toasting releases natural oils in the seeds.) Place potatoes, onion, and fennel wedges in a large bowl. Add the toasted fennel seed, rosemary sprigs, olive oil, and a few pinches of salt and pepper; toss.
2. Transfer the vegetable mixture to one large or two small parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. Roast 35 to 45 minutes or until vegetables are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven, toss with the chopped fennel tops, and serve warm. Makes 8 to 10 servings.

## SEASONAL SPREAD

It's a Florence Thanksgiving tradition to offer guests holiday starters that feature autumn fruits. Tyler serves sliced apples, crostini, and honey - still in the comb, from his own bees - alongside generous wedges of his favorite local blue cheeses. To sip, he serves cranberry-orange water and local cider spiced with anise and apple slices.
