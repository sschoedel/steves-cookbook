Spicy Thai Basil Chicken (Pad Krapow Gai) Recipe | Allrecipes

1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon brown sugar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped
¼ cup sliced shallots
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper
1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves
2 cups hot cooked rice

some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes. Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.

## Step 3

Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.

## Step 4

Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.

## Chef's Note:

Makes 2 large or 4 small portions.

## Tips

To slice basil leaves, stack about 5 of them and roll tightly like a cigar. Then slice into thin ribbons. Make a couple of cuts in the opposite direction for smaller pieces that cook faster.

# Spicy Thai Basil Chicken (Pad Krapow Gai)

★★★★★

My version of this classic Thai dish has spectacular taste even with regular basil instead of Thai or holy basil. The sauce actually acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. The recipe works best if you chop or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking.
