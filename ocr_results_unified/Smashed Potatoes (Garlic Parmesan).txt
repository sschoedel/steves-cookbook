## Equipment

- Heavy Duty Baking Sheet My favorite baking sheets I've had for years!

## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds small white potatoes
- 1 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Boil the potatoes. Place the potatoes in a pot and fill it with enough water to cover the potatoes by an inch. Salt the water (I use about a tablespoon of kosher salt). Bring the pot to a boil over medium-high heat, then cook the potatoes until fork-tender, about 15 minutes.
2. Drain and cool. Drain the potatoes in a colander and let them cool to the touch, about 10 minutes.
3. Season and flavor. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Transfer the potatoes to a mixing bowl, then add the oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Stir to fully coat the potatoes in the seasoning.
4. Smash the potatoes. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and use the bottom of a glass to smash them down. Thinner potatoes are more crispy, though are also more likely to break apart. Aim for a height of about ½-inch. Bake until the potatoes are golden and turning crispy, about 25 to 30 minutes.
5. Add parmesan cheese. Sprinkle the parmesan cheese evenly over the top and bake 5 minutes more.
6. Serve. If you'd like, sprinkle with chopped parsley before serving, then serve them up warm!

## Notes

- I do recommend finding really small potatoes or baby potatoes. They're easier to smash and more likely to crisp up!
- To make this recipe dairy-free, just omit the cheese. You can also add a sprinkle of nutritional yeast if you'd like, for a nod to that cheesy flavor.

# Smoked Fish Dip

I think this fish dip recipe is world-class and puts most others to shame! It is served in several prominent restaurants on the Gulf Coast of Florida. Serve with crackers, lemon or lime wedges, and capers.
