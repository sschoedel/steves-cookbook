# Ingredients

1 pound 1 2 1/2- to 3-pound spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon salt, divided
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
½ cup dry white wine, such as pinot grigio
1 pound peeled and deveined raw shrimp (16-20 per pound), tails left on if desired
1 tablespoon lemon juice
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
2 tablespoons 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
¼ teaspoon Lemon wedges for serving

# Directions

## Step 1

Place squash cut-side down in a microwave-safe dish; add 2 tablespoons water. Microwave, uncovered, on High until the flesh is tender, about 10 minutes. (Alternatively, place squash halves cut-side down on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven until the squash is tender, 40 to 50 minutes.)

## Step 2

Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic, coriander, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt and cayenne; cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add wine and bring to a simmer. Add shrimp and cook, stirring, until the shrimp are pink and just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice.

## Step 3

Use a fork to scrape the squash from the shells into a medium bowl. Add cilantro, butter, pepper and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt; stir to combine. Serve the shrimp over the spaghetti squash with a lemon wedge on the side.

# Tips

Cut Down on Dishes: A rimmed baking sheet is great for everything from roasting to catching accidental drips and spills. For effortless cleanup and to keep your baking sheets in tip-top shape, line them with a layer of foil before each use.
