## Honey-Garlic Chicken Thighs with Carrots & Broccoli

★★★★★

In this easy and healthy dinner recipe, sweet and savory baked honey-garlic chicken thighs come with a side of veggies that cook on the same sheet pan as the chicken. The honey-soy-garlic marinade for the chicken does double duty as an irresistible sauce to drizzle over everything. Lining your baking sheet with foil will protect your pan from the sticky honey-soy-garlic sauce, so cleanup will be a breeze too. If you can't find small carrots, cut medium carrots in half lengthwise.

|  Ingredients | Directions  |
| --- | --- |
|  ½ cup honey | **Step 1**
Whisk honey, soy sauce (or tamari), garlic, vinegar and crushed red pepper in a small bowl. Place chicken and half of the honey mixture (about 1/4 cup) in a zip-top plastic bag; remove excess air and seal bag. Massage the chicken in the sealed bag until well coated. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours. Reserve the remaining honey mixture.  |
|  1 ½ tablespoons reduced sodium soy sauce or tamari
4 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
8 (5 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
1 pound small carrots, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
4 cups broccoli florets (about 1 pound)
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground pepper | **Step 2**
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil; coat with cooking spray. Remove the chicken from the marinade (discard marinade); arrange on 1 side of the prepared pan. Combine carrots and 1 tablespoon oil in a medium bowl; toss well to coat. Spread the carrots in an even layer on the other side of the pan. Bake the chicken and carrots for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven; stir the carrots.  |
|   | **Step 3**
Combine broccoli and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil; toss well to coat. Distribute the broccoli evenly over the chicken and carrots on the pan. Sprinkle salt and pepper over all. Bake until the vegetables are tender and a thermometer inserted in the thickest portion of the chicken registers 165 degrees F, 15 to 18 minutes.  |

Meanwhile, whisk cornstarch and water in a small bowl until no clumps remain. Combine the cornstarch mixture and the reserved honey mixture in a small saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, whisking once or twice. Simmer, whisking often, until the sauce is clear and thickened, about 2 minutes. Drizzle over the chicken and vegetables. Serve hot.
