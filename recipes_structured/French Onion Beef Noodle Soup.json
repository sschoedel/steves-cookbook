    "1 4-inch piece ginger, scrubbed and thinly sliced",
    "6 star anise pods",
    "2 3-inch cinnamon sticks",
    "8 whole cloves",
    "2 teaspoons black peppercorns",
    "2 teaspoons coriander seeds",
    "1 cup dry white wine",
    "1/2 cup (or more) low-sodium soy sauce",
    "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",

  "instructions": [
    "Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Season short ribs with salt and, working in batches, cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides, 12-14 minutes. Transfer to a platter. Pour off excess fat, leaving just enough to cover bottom of pot.",
    "Return pot to medium heat. Cook whole white scallion parts, garlic, and ginger, stirring occasionally, until starting to brown, about 4 minutes. Add star anise, cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns, and coriander seeds and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 1 minute.",
    "Add wine, scraping up any browned bits. Simmer until almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Return beef to pot and add soy sauce and 12 cups water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover partially. Simmer until meat is not quite falling off the bone, about 1 1/2 hours.",
    "Meanwhile, heat butter in another large pot over medium-high until foaming subsides. Add onions, season with salt, and cook, stirring often, until they begin to take on some color, about 15 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are deep golden and softened but not mushy, 30-45 minutes.",
    "Using tongs, remove beef from broth and let cool. Tear meat into bite-size pieces, discarding bone and excess fat. Strain broth through a fine-mesh sieve; discard solids.",
    "Add meat and broth to pot with onions. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until liquid is reduced a bit and flavors have melded, about 30 minutes. Add vinegar; taste and add more vinegar and/or soy sauce if needed.",
    "Thinly slice remaining scallion greens. Cook noodles according to package directions. Divide among bowls. Ladle soup over noodles, making sure each bowl gets some meat and plenty of onions. Top with scallion greens and serve."
