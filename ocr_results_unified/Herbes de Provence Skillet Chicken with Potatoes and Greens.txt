## Ingredients

### For the marinade:
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken tenders, tenderloin, or thinly sliced chicken breasts
- 1 1/2 tablespoons herbes de Provence
- 1 1/4 teaspoons Kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
- Zest of one lemon
- 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 3 cloves minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

### For the vegetables:
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 3 tablespoons butter, divided
- 1 1/2 pounds B-sized or baby potatoes
- 1/2 yellow onion
- 1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt
- A few cracks of freshly ground pepper
- 2 handfuls (2 packed cups) Swiss chard or spinach
- 1/3 cup halved pimento-stuffed Spanish olives
- 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar

## Method

1. Label the bag:
Use a sharpie to write the date and title of the recipe on a gallon-sized zip top bag so you can easily find it on SimplyRecipes.com when you want to cook it. Alternatively, write the cooking instructions on the bag, and date it.

2. Combine the ingredients:
Roll down the opening of the bag a little just so you don't accidentally get raw chicken juices on the outside of the zip top. Add the chicken, spices, zest, lemon juice, garlic and olive oil.

Remove as much air as possible and seal the bag. Smooth the chicken around so it's coated in the marinade.

3. Lay the chicken flat in the freezer and freeze for up to 6 months:
Alternatively, you could skip the freezer and let it marinade in the fridge for a couple of hours and up to two days, then cook it according to the directions below.

4. Thaw the chicken before cooking:
When ready to cook, take the chicken out of the freezer in the morning before you go to work, and it will be ready to cook by the end of the day.

5. Prepare the vegetables:
If the b-sized potatoes are larger than a golf ball, quarter them; if they are smaller just half them. Slice the onion. Wash the Swiss chard, remove the stems and chop them. Then cut the leaves into strips about an inch thick. Cut the olives in half.

6. Cook the chicken:
Set a large skillet over medium heat add 2 teaspoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter. Once the oil shimmers and the butter melts, add the chicken and any marinade in the bag.

If any chicken is folded up, unfold it so it lays flat in the pan. Cook the chicken for 2 minutes, then flip it.

7. Add the vegetables:
Add the potatoes, onion, and 1/4 cup water to the pan with the chicken. Cover with a lid. Let everything simmer together for about 10 minutes.

8. Finish the potatoes and make the sauce:
Remove the chicken to a plate (leaving the vegetables in the skillet) and tent with foil. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a few cracks of freshly ground pepper to the skillet. Stir the potatoes, cover and cook for another 10 minutes.

Turn the heat up to medium high to reduce the liquid and finish cooking the potatoes uncovered. This should take about 2 to 3 minutes depending on how much liquid is in the pan.

When you can easily pierce the potatoes with a fork, add the chard leaves and chopped stems, olives, and red wine vinegar. Toss gently until the greens are just wilted.

9. Serve:
Nestle the chicken back into the pan. Bring the whole thing over to the table and serve.
