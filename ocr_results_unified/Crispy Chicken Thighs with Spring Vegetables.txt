BY ANNA STOCKWELL EPICURIOUS APRIL 2017

The rich and zesty pan sauce is what makes this simple, seasonal supper something you’ll want to eat again and again.

**YIELD:** 4 servings
**ACTIVE TIME:** 45 minutes
**TOTAL TIME:** 45 minutes

## INGREDIENTS
- 8 small bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 3 pounds)
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
- 1 pound asparagus, trimmed
- 1 pound baby new potatoes, halved if larger than 1/2"
- 1 bunch radishes (about 1/2 pound), halved
- 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided
- 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon anchovy paste, or 6 fillets, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) cold butter, cut into 1-tablespoon pieces, divided
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, plus more for serving

## PREPARATION
Preheat oven to 450°F. Using kitchen shears, remove bones from chicken thighs, keeping skin and flesh intact; discard bones. Season chicken all over with 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper.

Toss asparagus, potatoes, radishes, 2 Tbsp. oil, and remaining 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper in a large bowl. Transfer everything but the asparagus to a rimmed baking sheet and roast 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, grease another rimmed baking sheet with 1 tsp. oil. Heat remaining 1 tsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Working in batches, sear chicken skin side down until skin is crisp and golden brown, 5-7 minutes. Transfer skin side up to prepared sheet. After all chicken is seared (reserve fat in skillet), transfer baking sheet to oven and roast until chicken is cooked though, 8-10 minutes.

When you open oven to roast chicken, remove baking sheet with vegetables, arrange asparagus over potatoes and radishes, then continue to roast until asparagus is crisp-tender and potatoes and radishes are well browned and tender, 8-10 minutes more (it should take the same amount of time to finish as the chicken).

Meanwhile, carefully pour off excess fat from reserved skillet, leaving browned bits on the bottom. Add garlic, anchovy paste, and 1 Tbsp. butter to skillet and cook over medium heat until garlic is softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine, scraping up browned bits with a spatula or wooden spoon, and continue to cook, stirring, until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat

and stir in lemon juice. Add remaining butter one piece at a time, swirling and stirring after each addition to fully emulsify sauce. Stir in 1 Tbsp. parsley.

Transfer chicken and vegetables to a platter, then pour sauce over. Top with more parsley before serving.

**Cooks' Note**

You can keep the bones in your chicken thighs if you prefer - roast in oven 12-14 minutes instead of 8-10.
