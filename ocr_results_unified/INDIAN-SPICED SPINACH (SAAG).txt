☐ 1/2 cup onion, minced
☐ 4 cloves garlic
☐ 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
☐ 300 grams frozen spinach
☐ 2 teaspoons ground coriander

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Defrost and cook the spinach according to the package directions. Set aside.
2. Fry the onions, ginger, and garlic in the oil over medium heat, for about 4 or 5 minutes or until lightly browning.
3. Add the dry spices and continue frying for another 15 minutes. You will need to stir this every few minutes or so. The mixture will get dryer as you fry it. Add a tablespoon of water when it gets too dry.
4. Add the spinach and yogurt and heat through.
