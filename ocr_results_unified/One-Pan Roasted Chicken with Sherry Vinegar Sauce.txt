# One-Pan Roasted Chicken with Sherry Vinegar Sauce

By Alexandra Stafford

This recipe is featured in the story, *The One-Pot Chicken I've Been Making on Repeat for a Decade*, sponsored by *Bosch*. Adapted from a favorite recipe in Sally Schneider's *A New Way to Cook*. Having learned from *Diana Henry's Moroccan Chicken and Rice recipe* that the chicken need not be browned before throwing everything in the oven, I tried the method with Sally's chicken. It worked beautifully. The only trick is to skim the fat off the sauce at the end while the chicken rests, which leaves you with a tasty, rich, concentrated sauce, perfect for mopping up with bread. I like serving this with a green salad on the side.

Serves 4 to 6
**Prep time: 5 min**
**Cook time: 1 hrs**

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 to 2 shallots, thinly sliced to yield a heaping 1/4 cup
- kosher salt and pepper to taste
- 6 to 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- 2 to 3 Roma tomatoes, diced to yield 1 cup
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 2/3 cups Sherry, such as Harvey's Bristol Cream, or white wine
- 1/3 cup sherry vinegar or other
- 2 cups water
- bread for serving

1. Preheat the oven to 400° F. In a large skillet over high heat, heat the oil until it shimmers. Add the shallots and immediately reduce the heat to medium. Add a pinch of salt, and sauté until the shallots are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, place the chicken in a large bowl. Pat dry. Season all over with salt and pepper.
3. Add the tomatoes to the pan and cook for 1 minute. Add the mustard and cook for 30 seconds, stirring to incorporate it. Add the sherry, sherry vinegar, and water and bring to a simmer. Transfer the chicken pieces to the pan skin side up. Transfer pan to the oven and roast for 40 to 50 minutes or until the skin is evenly golden brown.
4. Remove pan from the oven, and transfer chicken to a plate to rest. Pour juices from the pan into a large bowl or large liquid measure. Let liquids sit for a minute or two until the fat rises to the surface. Use a spoon or ladle to remove fat. Taste juices. Adjust with salt or pepper. Return juices and chicken to the pan. Bring to a gentle simmer. Serve chicken with plenty of juices pooling all around - I like using shallow bowls for this one. Serve with crusty bread, if you wish.
