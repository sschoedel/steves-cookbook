# Epicurious White Chicken Chili

BY LISA LEAKE OCTOBER 2016 100 DAYS OF REAL FOOD

Whether you call this dish a chili or hearty chicken and bean stew, it's definitely a winner. The first time I made it for my kids, they asked me so many times what it was called, but by the end of the meal they cared much more about getting second helpings than remembering the name! If you have time be sure to double the recipe and store in the fridge or freezer, because, like most soups and stews, the leftovers are amazing.

**YIELD:** Serves 4 **ACTIVE TIME:** 10-15 minutes **TOTAL TIME:** Less than 30 minutes

## INGREDIENTS

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 onion, diced
- 1/2 jalapeño, minced
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/2 cup frozen corn kernels (no need to thaw)
- 2 (15-ounce) cans white beans (such as Great Northern or cannellini), drained and rinsed
- 1 3/4 cups chicken broth, store bought or homemade
- 1/4 cup heavy cream

## Optional toppings:

- Chopped cilantro, sour cream, grated Monterey Jack cheese, diced avocado, and/or corn tortilla strips

## PREPARATION

In a medium soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and jalapeño and cook, stirring, until the onion has softened, 2 to 3 minutes.

Add the chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is lightly browned on the outside and no longer pink on the inside (add more olive oil if the pot starts to dry out), 4 to 5 minutes.

Toss the minced garlic and spices into the pot and turn a few times to coat the chicken evenly. Add the corn, beans, and chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, about 20 minutes.

Break up some of the beans with the back of a wooden spoon to help thicken the chili. Stir in the cream, garnish with the desired toppings, and serve!

**Lisa's Tip**

This dish is also great with leftover cooked chicken. Just skip step 2 and add the cooked chicken with the garlic and spices in step 3.
