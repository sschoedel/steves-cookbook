  "ingredients": [
    "1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 8 thighs)",
    "Kosher salt",
    "Black pepper",
    "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil",
    "1 yellow onion, chopped",
    "3 garlic cloves, minced",
    "2 carrots, peeled and chopped",
    "1 red bell pepper, chopped",
    "1 zucchini, chopped",
    "1 potato, chopped",
    "1 teaspoon paprika",
    "1 teaspoon coriander",
    "1 teaspoon dried oregano",
    "1 28-ounce can whole tomatoes (San Marzano preferred)",
    "2 cups low sodium chicken broth",
    "2 sprigs fresh thyme",
    "1 tablespoon white wine vinegar",
    "1 cup chopped parsley leaves"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Pat the chicken dry and season on one side with a good pinch of salt and pepper.",
    "In a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil until shimmering. Add the chicken, starting with the seasoned side down. Sprinkle the top with salt and pepper, then cook until browned on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the second side, about 3 minutes more. Remove the chicken and set aside on a plate.",
    "With the heat still on medium-high, add the onion, garlic, carrot, bell pepper, zucchini and potato. Season with the paprika, coriander, oregano, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the veggies have softened and lightly charred, about 7 to 8 minutes.",
    "Stir in the tomatoes, chicken broth, and thyme sprigs. Use a wooden spoon to break up the tomatoes, pushing down until they burst into chunks.",
    "Raise the heat to bring to a boil, then add the chicken back to the pot. Cook on high heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Lower the heat to medium-low and cover the Dutch oven part-way. Let simmer until the stew has thickened and the chicken is nicely tender, 20 to 30 minutes.",
    "Turn the heat off and remove the thyme sprigs. Stir in the vinegar and fresh parsley and serve."

  "notes": [
    "Crock Pot Option: Follow steps 1 and 2 for seasoning and browning your chicken, then transfer the chicken to a large crock pot. Add the remaining ingredients, except the vinegar and fresh parsley. Cover and cook until the chicken is cooked through and tender, 5 to 6 hours on low heat or 3 to 4 hours on high heat. Stir in the vinegar and parsley just before serving.",
    "Leftovers and storage: Seal and store leftovers in the fridge for 4 days or so. You can also freeze this stew for later use for up to 2 months. Thaw in the fridge overnight. Reheat thawed or refrigerated soup over medium heat until warmed through."
