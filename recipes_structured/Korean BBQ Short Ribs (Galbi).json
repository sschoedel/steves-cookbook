  "instructions": [
    "To marinate ribs: Combine pear, garlic, tamari, oil, sugar, ginger and pepper in a medium bowl, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Add ribs and massage the marinade into them. Cover and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, for at least 2 hours or up to 1 day.",
    "To grill ribs: Preheat grill to high.",
    "Lightly oil the grill rack. Shake any excess marinade off the ribs. Grill, without crowding, 30 to 45 seconds per side for rare, or longer if desired. Let rest on a clean cutting board for 5 minutes, then cut each in half.",
    "To serve: Assemble 12 lettuce wraps with 1 perilla leaf, 1/4 cup rice, one piece of meat and 1 teaspoon Ssamjang each. Garnish with kimchi, if desired."

  "notes": [
    "Perilla leaves are slightly thick and minty tasting, often used in place of lettuce to wrap up foods in Korean cooking. Shiso or even large mint leaves make a good substitute."
