  "servings": "8-10",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 (12-oz) bags fresh cranberries",
    "2 oranges, seeded and coarsely chopped",
    "1 large Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, and coarsely chopped",
    "1/4 cup Grand Marnier or orange juice",
    "1 cup white sugar",
    "2 whole cinnamon sticks",
    "1/2 teaspoon fresh shaved nutmeg"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Place cranberries, oranges, and apple in a food processor (in batches if needed). Pulse 8 to 10 times or until mixture is coarsely chopped.",

    "Cover with plastic and let stand at room temperature for at least 6 hours or, ideally, overnight (refrigerate if using orange juice rather than Grand Marnier). This will allow the fruit to macerate and break down into a sauce.",
