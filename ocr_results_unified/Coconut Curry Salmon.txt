# Ingredients

3 Scotch bonnet peppers, seeded, stemmed, and chopped (substitute habanero peppers if needed)
1/2 cup white balsamic (substitute apple cider vinegar if needed)
Pinch of kosher salt, plus more as needed
Pinch of granulated sugar
4 tablespoons vegetable or another neutral oil, divided
4 (6-ounce) fillets Coho salmon (such as Secret Island)
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 medium (9-ounce) yellow onion, finely chopped
4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves
1 green bell pepper, finely chopped
2 tablespoons tomato paste
3 tablespoons Madras curry powder
1 (13 1/2-ounce) can full fat coconut milk, well-shaken
10 ounces vegetable or chicken stock, or water
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus more as needed
5 green onions, thinly sliced, divided
6 cups cooked rice or coconut rice, for serving

# Directions

## Step 1

Combine Scotch bonnet and vinegar with a pinch of both salt and sugar in a blender. Puree until smooth. Set aside.

## Step 2

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wide, medium saucepan over high heat. Season salmon with salt and add to pan, skin side down. Cook 3 minutes, then flip salmon over and add butter. Sear salmon until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Set aside.

## Step 3

Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper and cook until translucent, stirring frequently, about 7 minutes. Add garlic, thyme, all but 1 tablespoon green onion, and curry powder and cook until fragrant, 2 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook 2 minutes, stirring to coat vegetables with tomato paste. Add coconut milk and stock to pot. Season with a pinch of salt and lemon juice and stir.

## Step 4

Bring sauce to a boil then lower heat to medium-low and simmer sauce until slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Add salmon to sauce and simmer 3 minutes. Spoon salmon and sauce over rice, garnish with remaining green onion, and serve with pepper sauce.
