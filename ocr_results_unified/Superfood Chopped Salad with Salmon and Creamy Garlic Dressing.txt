## Superfood Chopped Salad with Salmon & Creamy Garlic Dressing

★★★★☆

Curly kale forms the base of this salad, but you could use chard or spinach. To the greens, add a multitude of chopped veggies, such as broccoli, cabbage and carrots. Finish with rich salmon for protein and a drizzle of creamy yogurt dressing to bring it all together.

### Ingredients

- 1 pound salmon fillet
- ½ cup low-fat plain yogurt
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives
- 2 teaspoons reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce
- 1 medium clove garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon ground pepper
- 8 cups chopped curly kale
- 2 cups chopped broccoli
- 2 cups chopped red cabbage
- 2 cups finely diced carrots

### Directions

#### Step 1

Arrange rack in upper third of oven. Preheat broiler to high. Line a baking sheet with foil.

#### Step 2

Place salmon on the prepared baking sheet, skin-side down. Broil, rotating the pan from front to back once, until the salmon is opaque in the center, 8 to 12 minutes. Cut into 4 portions.

#### Step 3

Meanwhile, whisk yogurt, mayonnaise, lemon juice, Parmesan, parsley, chives, tamari (or soy sauce), garlic and pepper in a small bowl.

#### Step 4

Combine kale, broccoli, cabbage, carrots and sunflower seeds in a large bowl. Add 3/4 cup of the dressing and toss to coat. Divide the salad among 4 dinner plates and top each with a piece of salmon and about 1 tablespoon of the remaining dressing.
