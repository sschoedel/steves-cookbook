DIRECTIONS: Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the soba and cook until al dente, about 3 minutes; drain. Rinse the soba under cold water and drain, shaking off any excess water. In a small skillet, toast the sesame seeds over moderate heat, stirring, until they begin to pop, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool.

In a small bowl, combine the chicken stock, soy sauce, sugar and sesame oil. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil. Add the bok choy, ginger, garlic and scallions and stir-fry over high heat until the bok choy is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add the soba noodles and cook, tossing, for 2 minutes. Add the soy mixture and bring to a boil, tossing. Remove from the heat and keep warm.

Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Season the fish with salt and dust with the rice flour. Add the fish to the skillet, skin side down, and cook over high heat until crisp, about 4 minutes. Flip the fillets and cook until just opaque throughout, about 2 minutes longer.

Transfer the soba and bok choy to shallow bowls and top with the fish, skin side up. Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds and serve. Recipe courtesy of Chasing Venus
