2 Fry the onions, ginger, and garlic in the oil over medium heat, for about 4 or 5 minutes or until lightly browning.
3 Add the dry spices and continue frying to another 15 minutes. You will need to stir this every few minutes or so. The mixture will get dryer as you fry it. Add a tablespoon of water when it gets too dry.
4 Add the spinach and yogurt and heat through.
5 Blend until the spinach is your desired consistency. Taste, and add salt as needed. Salt will bring out all of the flavours.

## For variations

Stir in the paneer and/or chicken and heat through.
