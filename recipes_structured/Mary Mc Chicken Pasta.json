    "1 tsp dried thyme",
    "1 tsp dried rosemary",
    "1 tsp red pepper flakes",
    "1 tsp salt",
    "1/2 tsp black pepper",

    "Over medium-high heat, sear the chicken about 5-6 minutes each side.",
    "Once seared, set aside on a plate. Cut the chicken into strips - it's ok if it is not 100% cooked at this point. It will finish cooking in the sauce.",

    "Simmer while pasta starts to cook.",
