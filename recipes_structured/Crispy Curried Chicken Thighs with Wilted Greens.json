  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oven to 400°F. Make sure the oven is hot before you start the chicken.",
    "In a large bowl, toss chicken with curry powder, salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon olive oil until well coated.",
    "Warm a large, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Place the chicken, skin-side down, in the hot skillet. Cook for about 3 minutes, until the skin is crispy and some fat renders out. Flip chicken over so it's skin-side up, and pour off excess fat.",
    "Transfer the chicken in the skillet to the oven. Roast for 16 to 18 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165°F.",
    "Remove the skillet from the oven. Transfer the chicken to a plate and let it rest.",
    "Ten minutes before the chicken is ready, begin cooking the onions: Warm another large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the onions and a pinch of salt, and saute for about 5 minutes until a bit translucent with a little browning.",
    "Stir in the ginger and garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds.",
    "Add 1/3 cup of chicken broth or water to the pan and stir to combine with the onions, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to a boil, then add all the greens. Stir to coat.",
    "Cook, stirring occasionally, until the greens are wilted and tender, 2 to 5 minutes. Taste and add additional salt and pepper if needed.",
    "Transfer the greens to a serving platter and place the chicken on top, spooning some of the liquid from the pan over top. Add lemon wedges and garnish with fresh herbs and sliced green onion."
