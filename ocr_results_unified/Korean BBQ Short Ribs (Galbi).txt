## Korean BBQ Short Ribs (Galbi)

The longer you marinate these Korean sweet-and-savory ribs, the better. Look for flanken-cut short ribs in the meat department or ask your butcher to cut them for you. If you can't find perilla or shiso leaves, try using mint instead.

## Directions

### Step 1

To marinate ribs: Combine pear, garlic, tamari, oil, sugar, ginger and pepper in a medium bowl, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Add ribs and massage the marinade into them. Cover and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, for at least 2 hours or up to 1 day.

### Step 2

To grill ribs: Preheat grill to high.

### Step 3

Lightly oil the grill rack. Shake any excess marinade off the ribs. Grill, without crowding, 30 to 45 seconds per side for rare, or longer if desired. Let rest on a clean cutting board for 5 minutes, then cut each in half.

### Step 4

To serve: Assemble 12 lettuce wraps with 1 perilla leaf, 1/4 cup rice, one piece of meat and 1 teaspoon Ssamjang each. Garnish with kimchi, if desired.

### Tips

Tips: Perilla leaves are slightly thick and minty tasting, often used in place of lettuce to wrap up foods in Korean cooking. Shiso or even large mint leaves make a good substitute.
