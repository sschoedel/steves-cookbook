    "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons whole cumin seed (or 1 teaspoon ground)",

    "4 cloves garlic",
    "1 1/2 cups medium packed parsley leaves",
    "1 1/2 cups medium packed cilantro leaves and tender stems",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt (for sauce)",
    "1/2 teaspoon paprika",
    "1 teaspoon lemon zest",
    "1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil",
    "2 tablespoons lemon juice"

  "instructions": [
    "Salt chicken thighs on both sides and let rest while you prepare the sauce.",
    "If using whole cumin and coriander seeds, lightly toast in a small skillet on medium heat, until fragrant. Put into a mortar and pestle and grind until powdery.",
    "Make the chermoula sauce: Put 4 cloves garlic, parsley, cilantro, salt, cumin, coriander, paprika, and lemon zest in a food processor. Pulse several times. With the motor running, slowly add in 1/2 cup of olive oil, then the lemon juice. Process until you have a smooth paste. You should have almost a cup of chermoula sauce.",
    "Brown chicken thighs in skillet: Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil on medium high heat in a large cast iron pan and preheat oven to 350°F. Pat dry the chicken pieces and place them skin side down in the hot pan. Let them cook until deep golden brown, about 5 to 6 minutes. Then turn them over and cook a few minutes more.",
    "Drain excess fat: Because you are working with skin-on thighs, you will likely render quite a bit of fat. Remove the chicken from the pan and pour off any excess fat. Return the chicken to the pan.",
    "Spread chermoula on chicken, bake in oven: Spread most of the chermoula sauce on both sides of the chicken thighs, reserving 1/4 cup of the fresh sauce to add later. With the chicken skin-side up, put the skillet in the 350°F oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the thighs are cooked through and the temperature near the bone is 165°F.",
    "Stir the reserved fresh chermoula sauce in with the pan sauce. Spoon sauce over the chicken to serve. Serve with couscous or with basmati rice for a gluten-free option."
