  "servings": "4",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 tsp peanut or vegetable oil, divided",
    "2 lb asparagus, trimmed, cut on a diagonal into 1-2 inch pieces",
    "8 oz ground pork",
    "6 scallions, white and pale green parts only, finely chopped",
    "5 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
    "1 2-inch piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped",
    "2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine (Chinese rice wine) or medium-dry sherry",
    "2 tablespoons soy sauce",
    "1 tsp toasted sesame oil",
    "Salt",
    "Rice and chili crisp for serving"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Heat 1 tsp peanut oil in a large skillet over high. Once pan is hot (oil will be lightly smoking), add half of asparagus and a couple pinches of salt and cook, tossing only once or twice so the pieces have a chance to blister, until crisp-tender and lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer asparagus to a plate. Add 1 tsp peanut oil to skillet (no need to wipe it out) and repeat process with remaining asparagus.",
    "Reduce heat to medium-high; add remaining 1 tsp peanut oil to skillet, then add pork, spreading out into an even layer. Season with a couple pinches of salt and cook, undisturbed, until meat begins to brown underneath, about 2 minutes. Break up meat with a wooden spoon and add scallions, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring, until pork is crisp and mixture is very fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add wine and soy sauce and return asparagus to skillet. Cook, turning to coat with pork mixture, until heated through, about 1 minute.",
    "Transfer stir-fry to a platter or large shallow bowl and drizzle with sesame oil. Serve with rice and chili crisp."
