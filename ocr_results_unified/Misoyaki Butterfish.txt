# Misoyaki Butterfish

Misoyaki Butterfish is a classic Hawaii recipe (you can even buy it at Costco Hawaii!) It's call butterfish, because the texture is rich and buttery. Just marinate black cod fillets in this miso marinade, then cook in the oven.

## Ingredients

- Four black cod fillets (6-8 ounces each)
- ½ cup mirin
- ½ cup sake

1. Make the marinade, Combine mirin, sake, and sugar in a saucepan. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil and then turn the heat to low.
