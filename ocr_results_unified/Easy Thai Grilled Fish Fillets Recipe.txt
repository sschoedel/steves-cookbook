Creating amazing-tasting grilled fish starts with a delicious sauce. This Thai recipe combines soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, garlic, lime juice, and red chile pepper to make a mixture that acts as both marinade and sauce, glaze, or dipping sauce. It will work with all types of fish, whether fillet or steak, salmon or sole. Marinate the fish briefly in this sauce, heat up your grill, and you are only a few minutes away from a flavorful fish dish that is easy enough for a weeknight but special enough for guests. Serve with jasmine rice and grilled

Vee A Note From Our Recipe Tester

"I used all of the seeds from the red chile pepper and found the marinade/sauce to be a fabulous balance of sweet, heat, and salty soy. A perfect complement to the delicate cod tenderloin, where flavor is added without being overpowering."  - Mary Jo Romano

## Ingredients

For the Marinade/Sauce:
- 3 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce, more to taste
- 2 tablespoons lightly packed brown sugar
- 4 to 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice
- 2 teaspoons fish sauce, more to taste
- 1 red chile, minced

For the Fish:
- 4 (6-to 8-ounce) skinless mild white fish fillets, such as snapper or cod
- Neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola
- Lime or lemon wedges, for garnish

## Steps to Make It

01 Gather the ingredients.

02 In a medium bowl, stir together the oyster sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, lime juice, fish sauce, and red chile until the sugar dissolves.

03 Place fish fillets in a flat-bottomed dish and pour over half of the marinade. Reserve the rest of the marinade for later. Turn fillets in sauce to coat all sides. Allow fish to marinate for at least 15 minutes while warming up the grill. It's best to make the grill hot but not blazing, or it will burn the tender flesh of the fish. You should hear a nice sizzle when you place the fish on the grill.

04 Lightly brush fish with oil.

05 Place fish on the grill and let sear undisturbed for at least 2 minutes. Grill fish for an additional 3 to 6 minutes per side (depending on thickness), until the internal temperature reaches 145 F, the fish flakes easily, and the flesh is no longer translucent. Avoid turning fish too soon or it may stick to the grill.

06 Warm the remaining marinade or use it at room temperature as a glaze or dipping sauce. Garnish fish with fresh lime or lemon wedges, and serve.

## Tips

- If you'd rather cook the fish in the oven, place the fish in a covered baking dish along with the marinade. Bake at 400 F for 20 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily, and the inner flesh is no longer translucent.

- If the fish is too thin or delicate to grill, you may want to use a "fish cage," which makes flipping the fish easier. Another method is to place aluminum foil or banana leaves over the grill grates. Both the cage and the foil should be coated with oil to avoid sticking.
