# Roasted Chicken Legs with Potatoes and Kale

For this easy one-pan dish, Grace Parisi roasts chicken legs on a bed of potatoes and kale so the meaty juices keep the vegetables moist. Prep takes just 10 minutes and the resulting meal serves eight or makes for excellent leftovers. There's very little clean-up as everything bakes up together and can be served straight from the pan. It's super healthy from the kale and lemon, but also hearty because of the roasted potatoes. Slideshow: Amazing Chicken Recipes

Total Time: 1 hrs

# Ingredients

- 1 1/2 pounds tender, young kale, stems and inner ribs removed.
- 1 1/2 pounds medium Yukon Gold potatoes, sliced 1/4 inch thick
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- 8 whole chicken legs (about 10 ounces each)
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- Lemon wedges, for serving

# Directions

## Step 1

Preheat the oven to 450°. In a very large roasting pan, toss the kale, potatoes and onion with the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and spread in an even layer.

## Step 2

Set the chicken on a cutting board, skin side down. Slice halfway through the joint between the drumsticks and thighs. Season with salt and pepper, sprinkle with the paprika and set on top of the vegetables.

## Step 3

Cover the pan with foil. Roast the chicken in the upper third of the oven for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and roast for 30 minutes longer, until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender. Transfer the chicken to plates and spoon the vegetables alongside. Serve with lemon wedges.

# Serve With

Combining chicken, greens, and potatoes, this one-pan recipe is a meal in itself, but it would also be delicious with homemade hummus or other easy spreads like a cucumber-yogurt dip.
