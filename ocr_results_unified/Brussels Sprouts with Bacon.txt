RECIPE FOR: Brussels Sprouts with Bacon

1 TBS veggie oil
1/2 lb sliced bacon, cut into thin strips
1/2 C minced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 C dry white wine
2 lb Brussels sprouts, ends trimmed
5 C chicken stock, veggie stock, or water

Warm oil in heavy-bottomed pot set over medium heat. Add bacon & cook until crisp, about 8 min. Add onion & garlic. Saute gently until softened but not browned, 5-7 minutes. Add wine, raise heat to high, & bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up any

flavorful bits of bacon stuck to bottom of the pan. When the wine has nearly evaporated, about 5 min., add Brussels sprouts. Add stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat & let stock simmer until sprouts are easily pierced with a knife, 12 to 15 minutes. Serve sprouts in a bowl, "family style."
