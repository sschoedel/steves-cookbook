## Step 2

Cut cabbage in half through core. Cut each half into 4 wedges. Heat ¼ cup oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Working in batches if needed, arrange cabbage in pan, cut side down, and season with salt. Cook until cut sides are lightly charred, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer cabbage to a plate.

## Step 3

Pour remaining ¼ cup oil into same skillet. Add spiced tomato paste, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring often, until beginning to split and darkened slightly, about 3 minutes. Pour in water to come halfway up sides of pan (about ½ cups), season with salt, and bring to a simmer. Nestle cabbage wedges back into skillet (they should have shrunk while browning; a bit of overlap is okay). Transfer skillet to oven and bake cabbage, turning halfway through, until liquid is mostly evaporated and cabbage is deeply browned around the edges and very tender, 40-50 minutes.

## Step 4

To serve, scatter cilantro over cabbage; top with yogurt and pepper.
