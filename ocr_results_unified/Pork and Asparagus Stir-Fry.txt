# Pork and Asparagus Stir-Fry

March 17, 2020

## Ingredients

### 4 SERVINGS

3 tsp. peanut or vegetable oil, divided
2 lb. asparagus, trimmed, cut on a diagonal into 1"-2" pieces
8 oz. ground pork
6 scallions, white and pale green parts only, finely chopped
5 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 2" piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped
2 Tbsp. Shaoxing wine (Chinese rice wine) or medium-dry sherry
2 Tbsp. soy sauce
1 tsp. toasted sesame oil

## Preparation

### Step 1

Heat 1 tsp. peanut oil in a large skillet over high. Once pan is hot (oil will be lightly smoking), add half of asparagus and a couple pinches of salt and cook, tossing only once or twice so the pieces have a chance to blister, until crisp-tender and lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer asparagus to a plate. Add 1 tsp. peanut oil to skillet (no need to wipe it out) and repeat process with remaining asparagus.

### Step 2

Reduce heat to medium-high; add remaining 1 tsp. peanut oil to skillet, then add pork, spreading out into an even layer. Season with a couple pinches of salt and cook, undisturbed, until meat begins to brown underneath, about 2 minutes. Break up meat with a wooden spoon and add scallions, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring, until pork is crisp and mixture is very fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add wine and soy sauce and return asparagus to skillet. Cook, turning to coat with pork mixture, until heated through, about 1 minute.

### Step 3

Transfer stir-fry to a platter or large shallow bowl and drizzle with sesame oil. Serve with rice and chili crisp.
