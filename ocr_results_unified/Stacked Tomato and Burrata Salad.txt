## Stacked Tomato and Burrata Salad

★★★★★

Comparing mozzarella and burrata is a little unfair, as burrata is significantly richer and creamier. It's not like comparing apples and oranges; it's more like apples and supermodels. In fact, burrata means 'buttered,' which is really all you need to know.

By Chef John

## Ingredients

- 1 vine-ripened tomato, cored and cut into 1/2-inch slices
- Flaked sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup burrata cheese, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon torn fresh basil leaves, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

## Directions

### Step 1

Place bottom tomato slice onto a plate and season with sea salt and black pepper. Spread burrata cheese over tomato slice and top with torn basil leaves. Drizzle with olive oil. Top with next tomato slice. Repeat cheese-tomato layering process with remaining slices, finishing with top tomato slice.

### Cook's Notes:

You can substitute mozzarella cheese for the burrata cheese, if desired.
