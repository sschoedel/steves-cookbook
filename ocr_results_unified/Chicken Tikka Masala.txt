## Ingredients

### For the chicken:
- 1 1/4 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, thighs, or a mix
- 6 tablespoons plain whole milk yogurt
- 1/2 tablespoon grated ginger
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt

### For the tikka masala sauce:
- 2 tablespoons canola oil, divided
- 1 small onion, thinly sliced (about 5 ounces, or 1 1/2 cups sliced)
- 2 teaspoons grated ginger
- 4 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon ground coriander
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon garam masala

- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 (14-ounce) can crushed fire-roasted tomatoes (regular crushed tomatoes work, too)
- 6 tablespoons plain whole milk yogurt
- 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Cooked rice, to serve
- Cilantro, to garnish

## Method

1. Prepare the chicken:
Trim chicken thighs of any extra fat. Chop into bite-sized pieces about 1/2 to 1-inch wide. Place the chicken thigh pieces to a medium bowl.
Add the yogurt, ginger, garlic, cumin, paprika and salt. Using your hands, combine the chicken with the spices until the chicken is evenly coated.

2. Marinate the chicken:
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the chicken marinate in the fridge for at least 45 minutes or as long as overnight. (Marinating for 4 to 6 hours is perfect.)

3. Cook the chicken:
In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thigh pieces and cook for about 6 to 7 minutes, until they're cooked through. Transfer to a plate and set aside.

4. Toast the spices:
Wipe down the pan you used to cook the chicken. Heat remaining canola oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes, until softened, stirring often.
Add the grated ginger, minced garlic, coriander, paprika, garam masala, turmeric, black pepper, salt, and cayenne. Let the spices cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds to a minute.

5. Make the sauce:
Add the crushed tomatoes to the pan with the spices and let everything cook for 4 minutes, stirring often. Add the yogurt and stir to combine.

6. Simmer the sauce:
Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the sauce simmer for another 4 minutes. Add the chicken pieces to the pan and coat with sauce.

7. Serve:
Serve over cooked basmati rice and garnish with cilantro.
