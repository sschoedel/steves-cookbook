REAL SIMPLE

# Gochujang Gumbo

It's warming and spicy, but not too spicy. More like a building yet mild burn. Big flavor comes from Andouille sausage, garlic cloves, gochujang (Korean chile bean paste), and the red Fresno chiles. And it wouldn't be gumbo without a dusting of filé powder. Gochujang, available in the international aisle of most supermarkets, is treated like tomato paste: it's sautéed with the celery, bell pepper, and garlic at the beginning of the recipe so its flavor melds into the soup. Notice that a splash of red wine vinegar gets added to the gumbo when it's seasoned. Three tablespoons are enough to brighten the gumbo with a bit of acidity.
